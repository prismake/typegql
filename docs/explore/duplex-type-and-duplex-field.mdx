# Complex input types with `@DuplexObjectType` and `@DuplexField`

Sometimes we'd like to define a single type as both input and output object type. That's where DuplexObjectType comes in. Of course you only want to take a subset of all fields as input-so just mark those that you don't want in the input as regular `@Field()`.

```ts
import {
  DuplexObjectType,
  Field,
  DuplexField,
  Arg,
  InputObjectType,
  Mutation,
} from 'decapi'

@DuplexObjectType()
class User {
  @DuplexField()
  name: string
  @Field()
  password_hash: string
}

@Schema()
class SuperSchema {
  @Mutation()
  createUser(data: User): User {
    // now we can use a single class as input and output type
    const u = new User()
    u.name = data.name
    u.password_hash = bcrypt.hashSync('bacon')
    return u
  }
}
```
